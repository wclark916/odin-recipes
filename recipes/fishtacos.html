    <img src="./images/fishtacosd.jpg" alt="Plate of fish tacos">
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 cup mexican beer</li>
        <p>I prefer corona</p>
        <li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>2 lbs rockfish</li>
        <p>You can use cod or halibut but I like the flavor added by rockfish.</p>
        <li>Rubio's white sauce clone</li>
        <--link to white sauce recipe-->
        <li>1 package corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Salsa of choice</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
    </ul>   
    <p>I make the white sauce in advance and chill in fridgerator. 
        Also, salt to taste. You can add garlic
        and onion powder to batter for more 
        flavor.</p>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Make white sauce</li>
            <li>Step 2: Mix flour and beer into a bowl. 1 cup leaves a bit of a 12oz remaining if you're thirsty....</li>
            <li>Step 3: Shred cabbage if not done so and set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Heat oil for frying</li>
            <li>Step 5: Cut or portion fish into pieces, I prefer 1" by 3".
                        Its a matter of preference. I feel its a little easier to manage this way.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Dip your fish portions into batter one at a time making sure they are well coated.
            drop them into the fryer and cook until done. Removing them and allowing to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Step 7: Assemble Tacos, I start with a tortilla, add white sauce and then fish followed by
                        cabbage. Then add salsa and a sqeeze of lime juice from a wedge. </li>
             <li>Step 8: Enjoy</li>
